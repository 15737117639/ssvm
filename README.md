# Smooth Support Vector Machine Toolbox

## Introduction
SSVM toolbox is an implementation of Smooth Support Vector Machine in Matlab. SSVM is a reformulation of conventional SVM and can be solved by a fast Newton-Armijo algorithm. Besides, choosing a good parameter setting for a better performance in a learning task is an important issue. We also provide an automatic model selection tool to help users to get a good parameter setting. SSVM toolbox now includes smooth support vector machine for classification, epsilon-insensitive smooth support vector regression and an automatic model selection tool using uniform design.

## Key Features
* Solve classification (SSVM) and regression (SSVR) problems
* Support linear, polynomial and radial basis kernels
* Provide an automatic model selection for SSVM and SSVR with RBF kernels
* Can handle large scale problems by using reduced kernel (RSVM)
* Provide cross validation evaluation
* Provide an alternative initial point other than zero using regularized least squares

## Data Format
SSVM toolbox is implemented in Matlab. Use a data format which can be loaded into Matlab. The instances are represented by a matrix (rows for instances and columns for variables) and the labels (1 or -1) or responses are represented by a column vector.

For regression

Here are some sample datasets.

## Code Usage
SSVM toolbox contains three main functionsï¼š ssvm_train for SVMs training, ssvm_predict for SVMs prediction and hibiscus for automatic model selection.

### Usage of ssvm_train

`model = ssvm_train(label, inst, 'options')`
